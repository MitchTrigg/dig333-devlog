## Week 1

### Context

- The TedX video by Tom Igoe mentions alot of objects that have been created with his Arduino project. There have been many open sourced machines that have been created that are similar to the Arduino. There are also many bad things that have come out of this tech revolution like credit card skimmers.
- "The devices that we make and the devices that we use, what they do matters less than the relationships that we make through them and how they change our relationships."
- There are so many positive uses that came out of physical computing.
- Do the bad computers ever outweigh the good computers?






## Week 2

### Context

- The article "The Internet of Things: Roadmap to a Connected World" describes how the connectivity of our devices has grown and is projected to continue to grow in the oncoming years. The article mentions how there are problems associated with the privacy and security of people as the network continues to grow, as well as advancements in society like self-driving cars. The article "The Internet of Things has a Dirty Little Secret it's not really ours" describes how there are so many new and innovative products that serve little to no purpose and need an internet connection to complete basic tasks. This becomes a problem when the internet or electricity goes out though. 
- â€œCompanies should step up and guarantee the longevity of their products, no matter the cost or bind it might put them in."
- I agreed with the author of,"The Internet of Things has a Dirty Little Secret it's not really ours" about how there are so many simple products that have been unnecessarily complicated. 
- I would like to know why people continue to buy these products even though they become more of a headache than their old fashioned versions.

### Experiments

### Platt Chapter 1: Experiencing Electricity

1. Experiment 1: Taste the Power!
    1. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89601540/153111022-e5c88fc5-ed34-4256-9568-f4d352618187.png)

    3. What happens to the voltage if the current of a circuit is increased, but the resistance remains the same.
2. Experiment 2: Let's Abuse A Battery!
    1. Describing Ohm's Law using the water analogy.
        a. Voltage can be thought of as the height of the water level above the whole where water flows out. The volume of the water is irrelevant though.
        b. The resistance can be thought of as the area of the hole that water is spewing out of.
        c. The current can be thought of as the amount of water exiting the hole.
    2. Matching the units for voltage, current, and resistance
        a. Voltage is measured in volts.
        b. Current is measured in Amps.
        c. Resistance is measured in Ohms.
    3. Understanding three differences between AC and DC.
        a. AC current oscillates sinusoidally, sometimes going negative or zero.
        b. AC current is better for transmitting electrons long distances, because they don't really "travel", they more or less just oscillate within a conductor.
        c. Most simple electronic circuits use DC.
    4. An important concept is the difference between AC and DC.
    5. In the water analogy, why is the current of the water flowing out not dependent on the volume of water above the hole?

    6. The resistor can be place before or after the LED.
    7. An important concept was understanding how to create circuits, and how electrons flow through the circuits.
    8. What could you do to increase the luminosity of the LED?
4. Experiment 4: Varying the Voltage
    1. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89601540/153111129-8763e2b0-b2c8-4bcf-ae14-28065e2e1cca.png)
    2. Polarity is essentially the voltage or potential difference between two points of a circuit.
    3. You can check the voltage across parts of a circuit by connecting the multimeter in parallel with components of a circuit.
    4. You can measure the current at a point in your circuit by hooking up the multimeter in series in your circuit.
    5. There was about 1V of potential through the resistor and .0001A of current before the resistor.
    6. V= I x R. R = V/I. R = 1V/.0001A. R = 10k ohms.
5. Experiment 5: Let's Make a Battery
    1. Power(watts) = I x V.
    2. Batteries in series.
        a. Voltage increases as well as power.

    3. Pulling the plug can corrupt some files that were writing to the sd card.

## Week 3

### Context

- The "Critical Engineering Manifesto" is a bunch of rules that engineers are supposed to follow that also describe the job they do. The "Artistic Profile: Julian Oliver" is an interview of Julian Oliver where he comments on open source programs. "All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace" tells us about how Rand affected the economy.
- "The Critical Engineer considers any technology depended upon to be both a challenge and a threat. The greater the dependence on a technology the greater the need to study and expose its inner workings, regardless of ownership or legal provision."
- I thought this quote was interesting because of the development of AI and how there are alot of situations where computers can complete tasks better than humans.
- What are some of the downfalls of an overreliance on AI.

## Week 4


### Context

In "Pay for the Printer" by Philip K Dick, the setting takes place in a post apocalyptic Earth where Hydrogen bombs were dropped during a war. An alien race came to Earth and began printing new items based off of original copies, but it was not a sustainable solution, because eventually everything that was printed turns to pudding. "The Preserving Machine" also by Philip K Dick is about a machine that turns music into animals, but the animals adapted to nature and turned foul, turning the music foul with it. "I listened to the music. It was hideous. I have never heard anything like it. It was distorted, diabolical, without sense or meaning, except, perhaps, an alien, disconcerting meaning that should never have been there." I thought the stories by Dick were really interesting and thought provoking, even though both of them were pretty unrealistic. Considering the printing done in the first story, how relevant will 3D printing be in the future regarding cheap housing or easily printed products that can help alot of people for cheap.

## Week 5


### Context

- The article "Everying Thats Inside Your Iphone" by Brian Merchant describes the different elements that are used within an Iphone and how much is used. He breaks it down and comes up with the total raw cost of the materials to be a little over a dollar. He then describes where these materials come from which is from mines in poorer countries. A significant point is that these mines are also mined by children eventhough the conditions are awful and dangerous. The article "One Man's Nearly Impossible Task to Make a Toaster From Scratch" by Rachel Swaby is about a man that wanted to create a toaster from scratch using raw materials from the Earth. He broke down the cheapest toaster he could find and noticed there were hundreds of parts and materials within it. He ends up describing where he could find the materials he needed. The article "All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace" by Adam Curtis is about how altruism is defined by peoples genetics. He goes on to prove his theory using certain computer algorithms. 
- Brian Merchant mentions, "In 2008 alone, sixty children were killed in mining accidents at Cerro Rico."
- I thought it was crazy how complicated and dense Iphone components were.
- Considering many people will buy the new Iphone every year, do you think some people will wait a couple years for a new Iphone if they new how the Iphones were created?

### Platt Chapter 2: Switching Basics and More

1. Necessary Items For Chapter 2
    1. ![IMG_8176](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89601540/155003566-ee53f7d6-b80e-4889-ac82-86c6cc79dc79.jpg)

    2. Above from left to right the tool names are, pliers, wire stripper, and wire cutter.
    3. I couln't find any wire, but you just run it through the whole with the correct gauge and pull it hard with a pliers.
    4. I couln't find the capacitor, transistor, switch nor the relays, but there were trimpots. I do know what the other four look like though.
    5. Are you able to cut a wire with the wire stripper?
2. Experiment 6: Very Simple Switching
    1. The SPST switches have two terminals, with options to either connect the two terminals, or to not connect them. The SPDT switch has three terminals, with options to either connect the middle pole to the left throw or to connect the middle pole to the right throw. The pole is in the middle of the switch where the power is connected to.
    2. ![circuit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89601540/154182960-c2e8580e-5413-4804-b0fa-d2d38fa6cfc5.PNG)

    4. When I am pressing the button, the second LED is lit up. When I release it, the first LED is lit up and the second goes out.
    5. ![IMG_8239](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89601540/156044254-3a6f00ac-6440-47cd-b7f6-cd6e31d82449.jpg)

    6. This is just a better picture of my circuit.
    7. What purpose do relays serve?
4. Experiment 8: A Relay Oscillator
    1. Think of a resistor as a faucet and the capacitor as a balloon that is filling up with water. The balloon stops filling with water when the pressure inside the balloon is equal to the pressure in the pipe, regardless of how quickly the balloon fills up. The capacitor quits charging when it's voltage is the same as the supply's voltage. The resistance between the power supply and capacitor determines how quickly the capacitor charges.
    2. Capacitors that are large can hold a large voltage and can zap you if you touch it. 
    3. Capacitors can blow up if they are connected with the wrong current direction. 
    4. ![IMG_8240](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89601540/156044454-bd08e86a-74e1-49fc-bf34-4e7406ef0e90.jpg)

    7. When I was switching out capacitors, the time that the LED's took to dim changed. It changed quicker with smaller capacitors that hold a smaller voltage. It took longer to discharge on larger capacitors.
    8. What would happen if you add another capacitor in parallel?
5. Experiment 9: Time and Capacitors
    1. ![IMG_8242](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89601540/156044677-797e5eb9-fb92-49d8-b914-e1f55ee326e8.jpg)

    2. As I pushed and held the button, the circuit connected, which charged the capacitor. I could see the voltage increasing the longer I held the button down. When I released the button, the voltage slowly started to drop, discharging the capacitor.
    3. Does the current decrease along with the voltage within the capacitor?
6. Experiment 10: Transistor Switching
    1. ![IMG_8244](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89601540/156044755-22552e17-ab3d-401b-8f02-34e0cd2a63a5.jpg)

    2. This is the circuit containg a transistor LED and pushbutton. When I am not pressing on the button, the circuit is not complete and the LED is not on.
    3. ![IMG_8245](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89601540/156044779-361415b9-dba4-40d1-8de5-5d50c6b4d34b.jpg)

    4. When I press on the button, the LED lights up. The transisor spits out a voltage but recieves voltage from two different spots.
    5. What is the purpose of transistors?



## Week 6

### Context

- The article "Igloo White" by John Corell talks about the USA's defense plan of South Korea from a North Korean invasion. They used many different types of sensors including sound and hormone sensors to detect when trucks or people are within the area or trying to cross the border. If there is need for defensive measures, he mentions, " If circumstances warranted, strike aircraft might be on the scene in five minutes. The sensors continuously updated the location of the trucks as the strike aircraft approached." The article "Unseen Scensors: Constantly Sensing but Rarely Seen" by Mayo Nissen is an article about the many different types of sensors that have been created since entering this age of information. There are sensors that detect the amount of water a building is using to, sensors detecting heavy flows of traffic to, others that detect parked cars. These are just the sensors we know about. I thought it was kind of scary to see the large amount of sensors and how people are using this data. There might be some sensors that we don't see. Do you think it is wrong to have sensors that are hidden to the public?

    4. Some hazards of soldering electronics are the fumes of the solder melting. These fumes are very hazardous and can lead to respiratory problem. You can also burn yourself with the soldering iron, because the soldering iron gets very hot.
    5. What is one method of getting rid of the fumes while you are soldering?
2. Experiment 13: Broil an LED
    1. The purpose of a heat sink is to divert some of the heat coming from the soldering iron to a different conductor that isn't heat sensitive and won't be destroyed. Many electronics components are sensitive to heat and can be destroyed when exposed to too much of it.

### Monk Chapter 8: Computer Vision



### Monk Chapter 9: Hardware Basics

1. Introduction
2. Finding Your Way Around the GPIO Connector
    1. The 40 pin layout contains the same pins as the 26 pin layout, along with three extra ground connections, nine GPIO pins, and an ID_SD and ID_SC pins.
    2. Digital pins can only send and recieve binary inputs and outputs while the analog pins can give inputs and outputs signals in a range between 1 and 0.
3. Keeping Your Raspberry Pi Safe When Using the GPIO connector
    1. Don't power the Pi with more than 5V.
    2. Don't put more than 3.3V into a GPIO pin.
    3. Don't touch the Pi with metal when it is powered on.
4. Setting Up I2C
5. Setting Up SPI
6. Using a Breadboard with Jumper Leads
    1. Below is an image of the RaspberryPi connected to a breadboard with connecting cables.
    2. ![IMG_8306](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89601540/159597207-c1cfdf2a-1cf2-44e1-91a3-10256b272ab8.jpg)
7. Using a Breadboard with a Pi Cobbler
    1. An advantage of using the cobbler is that you can assemble the needed electronic components and wires on the breadboard, then easily connect the cobbler to the breadboard.
8. Using a Raspberry Squid
    1. The Raspberry Squid is an LED that can light up red, blue, and green that can also be connected directly to the Raspberry Pi.
9. Converting 5V Signals to 3.3V with Two Resistors
10. Converting 5V Signals to 3.3V with a Level Converter Module
11. Powering a Raspberry Pi with Batteries
    1. You should not try to power your Pi with more or less than 5V.
    2. Typically you would use a larger batter like a 9V battery, then use a voltage regulator to drop the battery voltage to 5V.
12. Powering a Raspberry Pi with a LiPo Battery
13. Using a Pi Plate Prototyping Board
14. Making a HAT
15. The Pi Zero and Pi Zero W



### Monk Chapter 10: Controlling Hardware

1. Introduction
2. Connecting an LED
    1. The GPIO Zero library allows programmers to import the pins directly into the software and use them.
    2. The RPI GPIO accomplishes the same thing, except the code is more complicated.
    3. For the GPIO Zero:
    4. from gpiozero import LED
    5. led = LED(12)
    6. led.on()
    7. For the RPI GPIO
    8. import RPi.GPIO
    9. ledPin = 12
    10. GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
    11. GPIO.setup(ledPin, GPIO.Out)
    12. GPIO, output(ledPin, GPIO.High)
3. Leaving the GPIO Pins in a Safe State
    1. When you exit a program using the GPIO pins, the pins are put into a safe state meaning their outputs are reset so that you don't have any troubles if you wanted to start a new project with the same Raspberry Pi.
4. Controlling the Brightness of an LED
    1. Complete in class
6. Switching a High-Power DC Device Using a Transistor
7. Switching a High-Power Device Using a Relay
8. Controlling High-Voltage AC Devices
9. Controlling Hardware with Android and Bluetooth
10. Making a User Interface to Turn Things On and Off
11. Making a User Interface to Control PWM Power for LEDs and Motors
12. Changing the Color of an RGB LED
13. Using an Analog Meter as a Display



## Final Project Milestones:

### Milestone 1: Complete Stepper Motor Control

- Goal was to have a chassy that could move by itself with code.
- This is the circuit used for the stepper motor.
- ![schematic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89601540/163267191-950ed6b2-b79d-44f3-b3cb-6f2a8033d958.PNG)
- This link is the link that I used to complete the code for the stepper motor. https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-10-stepper-motors/configure-and-test
- This is the image of my circuit and chassy.
- ![IMG_8546](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89601540/163268549-7db297d9-b427-42f2-bf05-1eb7061bcd7b.jpg)

### Milestone 2: Constructing the Body

- Goal was to create the body of the robot by 3D printing it.
- The 3D printer wasn't working so I had to create it out of wood.
- I will have to clean it up some, and can't completely finish it because I need to install the servo motor in the head.
- This is the decorative part of the robot.
