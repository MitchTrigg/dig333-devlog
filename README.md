## Week 1

### Context

- The TedX video by Tom Igoe mentions alot of objects that have been created with his Arduino project. There have been many open sourced machines that have been created that are similar to the Arduino. There are also many bad things that have come out of this tech revolution like credit card skimmers.
- "The devices that we make and the devices that we use, what they do matters less than the relationships that we make through them and how they change our relationships."
- There are so many positive uses that came out of physical computing.
- Do the bad computers ever outweigh the good computers?






## Week 2

### Context

- The article "The Internet of Things: Roadmap to a Connected World" describes how the connectivity of our devices has grown and is projected to continue to grow in the oncoming years. The article mentions how there are problems associated with the privacy and security of people as the network continues to grow, as well as advancements in society like self-driving cars. The article "The Internet of Things has a Dirty Little Secret it's not really ours" describes how there are so many new and innovative products that serve little to no purpose and need an internet connection to complete basic tasks. This becomes a problem when the internet or electricity goes out though. 
- â€œCompanies should step up and guarantee the longevity of their products, no matter the cost or bind it might put them in."
- I agreed with the author of,"The Internet of Things has a Dirty Little Secret it's not really ours" about how there are so many simple products that have been unnecessarily complicated. 
- I would like to know why people continue to buy these products even though they become more of a headache than their old fashioned versions.

### Experiments

1. Experiment 1: Taste the Power!
    1. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89601540/153111022-e5c88fc5-ed34-4256-9568-f4d352618187.png)

    2. If the voltage is constant, and the resistance is increased, the current is decreased.
    3. What happens to the voltage if the current of a circuit is increased, but the resistance remains the same.
2. Experiment 2: Let's Abuse A Battery!
    1. Describing Ohm's Law using the water analogy.
        a. Voltage can be thought of as the height of the water level above the whole where water flows out. The volume of the water is irrelevant though.
        b. The resistance can be thought of as the area of the hole that water is spewing out of.
        c. The current can be thought of as the amount of water exiting the hole.
    2. Matching the units for voltage, current, and resistance
        a. Voltage is measured in volts.
        b. Current is measured in Amps.
        c. Resistance is measured in Ohms.
    3. Understanding three differences between AC and DC.
        a. AC current oscillates sinusoidally, sometimes going negative or zero.
        b. AC current is better for transmitting electrons long distances, because they don't really "travel", they more or less just oscillate within a conductor.
        c. Most simple electronic circuits use DC.
    4. An important concept is the difference between AC and DC.
    5. In the water analogy, why is the current of the water flowing out not dependent on the volume of water above the hole?
3. Experiment 3:Your First Circuit
    1. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89601540/153105195-df75d89e-a502-450f-96fe-deb03c950de4.png) 
    2. The resistor I used was brown, black, orange, gold.
    3. brown = 1, black = 0, orange = x1000, and gold = +- 5%.
    4. The resistor is 10,000 ohms.
    5. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89601540/153111080-2d1a753f-668e-4347-922a-4bf2743fd889.png)
    6. The resistor can be place before or after the LED.
    7. An important concept was understanding how to create circuits, and how electrons flow through the circuits.
    8. What could you do to increase the luminosity of the LED?
4. Experiment 4: Varying the Voltage
    1. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89601540/153111129-8763e2b0-b2c8-4bcf-ae14-28065e2e1cca.png)
    2. Polarity is essentially the voltage or potential difference between two points of a circuit.
    3. You can check the voltage across parts of a circuit by connecting the multimeter in parallel with components of a circuit.
    4. You can measure the current at a point in your circuit by hooking up the multimeter in series in your circuit.
    5. There was about 1V of potential through the resistor and .0001A of current before the resistor.
    6. V= I x R. R = V/I. R = 1V/.0001A. R = 10k ohms.
5. Experiment 5: Let's Make a Battery
    1. Power(watts) = I x V.
    2. Batteries in series.
        a. Voltage increases as well as power.
    3. Batteries in parallel.
        a. Current increases as well as power.
